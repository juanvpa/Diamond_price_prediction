# 

>### **INTRODUCTION**

#### The final weekly project in the Data Analytics Bootcamp is a competition to find the best model for prediction diamond prices based on nine given variables: 

- carat - cut - color - clarity - depth - table - x - y - z

#### Two datasets were given as part of the competition: 
- one for training the models, including the actual price
- one without prices to test the models
#

>### **WORK DONE**
#### As a first step, I cleaned the dataset to make it ready for the machine learning models. 


This included converting categorical variables to ordinal, checking for highly correlated variables that could be droped and checking for possible empty variables or zeros. 

#### Following the data cleaning process, I trained various machine learning models included in sklearn to predict diamond prices. 
I used linear regression & random forests. 

Work and results are summarized in the following slide:
